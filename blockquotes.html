    Some of the most inspirational quotes and Bible verses are those talking about the<code><mark></code> love of God.</p> <p> This attribute of God is one that makes me smile. What comfort we can find in a God that loves us despite of ourselves.</p><pre> God loves you and He wants you to know this! I know you came to this article looking for some great quotes and verses so I am going to let them do the rest of the talking</pre>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
God bestows His blessings without discrimination. The followers of Jesus are children of God, and they should manifest the family likeness by doing good to all, even to those who deserve the opposite


God waits for you to communicate with Him. You have instant, direct access to God. God loves mankind so much, and in a very special sense His children, that He has made Himself available to you at all times

One who has been touched by grace will no longer look on those who stray as “those evil people” or “those poor people who need our help.” Nor must we search for signs of “loveworthiness.” Grace teaches us that God loves because of who God is, not because of who we are.
